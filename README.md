# Motivation
For this project I wanted to create a simple web application that visualises some structured data. On the front-end, I wanted to learn JavaScript with the React framework and D3.js library. On the back-end, I wanted to learn REST API design in Python using Flask, as well as simple data requesting and manipulation processes. Lastly, I wanted to become acquainted with the process of deploying services to AWS.

# How To Use
The backend code in this repo will not run as the connection details to the MongoDB cluster have intentionally been obscured. This repo serves as an example of the REST API code used for [imdb-actor-network-visualiser-front](https://github.com/AmroNagdy/imdb-actor-network-visualiser-front).
