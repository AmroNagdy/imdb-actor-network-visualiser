# Motivation
For this project I wanted to develop a simple web interface that visualises some structured data using MongoDB and AWS for the backend. In doing so, I wanted to develop my JavaScript knowledge and use a popular data visualisation framework. I also wanted to apply Python to a more typical use-case: back-end data pulling and manipulation.

# How To Use
TBD
